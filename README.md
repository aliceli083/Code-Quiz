# Code-Quiz

## Description
This project involves using JavaScript to create an interactive code-quiz. I made use of a countdown, one second at a time starting from 90 seconds, and deducted 10 seconds for every incorrect answer. In the end the quiz taker will be left with a score equivalent to the remaining time, in seconds. The end of the quiz leads to the option of leaving initials and saving it using JSON.
